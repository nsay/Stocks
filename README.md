# Stocks

This demo implements classes for managing stock data. It contains a local database 'stocks' as well a Yahoo Finance stocks api.
Database is accessed via Hibernate database configuration relying on the existence of a database called 'stocks' granting all privileges to user 'monty' with password 'some_pass'.

*Currently Yahoo Stocks api is discontinued and not for public use.
